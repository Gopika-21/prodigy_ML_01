**House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
This project demonstrates a simple approach to predict house prices based on various factors using Linear Regression. We use a dataset of house features and their corresponding prices to train and evaluate a linear regression model, making it useful for understanding fundamental machine learning concepts and for exploring applications in real estate price predictions.

Results
The project evaluates model performance based on the following metrics:
1.Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
2.Mean Squared Error (MSE)
3.R-Squared (RÂ²)
You can find detailed analysis and model performance metrics in the results/ directory.

Future Work
1.Feature Engineering: Add more complex features like neighborhood crime rates, proximity to schools, etc.
2.Model Tuning: Explore advanced regression techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) or try other machine learning models.
3.Hyperparameter Optimization: Optimize model parameters for better accuracy.
4.Deploy the Model: Build a web application or API for the model to provide predictions for user inputs.
